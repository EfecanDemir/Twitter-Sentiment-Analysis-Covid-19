# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis-Covid-19 (Turkish)
* Sentiment analysis on tweets using Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest, LSTM. 
* Twitter Scraper - Scrape tweets for a user or a every word.

## Dataset Information

We use and compare various different methods for sentiment analysis on tweets (a binary classification problem). The training dataset is expected to be a csv file of type `Description,Sentiment_Analysis,Polarity,Topic` 

`Sentiment_Analysis` is either `1` (positive), `-1`(negative) and `0` (neutral). 

## Requirements

There are some general library requirements for the project and some which are specific to individual methods. The general requirements are as follows.  
* `numpy`
* `scikit-learn`
* `scipy`
* `nltk`

The library requirements specific to some methods are:
* `keras` with `TensorFlow` backend for LSTM
* `xgboost` for XGBoost.

**Note**: It is recommended to use Anaconda distribution of Python.

## Usage

### Preprocessing 

1. Run `preprocess.py <raw-csv-path>` on both train and test data. This will generate a preprocessed version of the dataset.
2. Run `stats.py <preprocessed-csv-path>` where `<preprocessed-csv-path>` is the path of csv generated from `preprocess.py`. This gives general statistical information about the dataset and will two pickle files which are the frequency distribution of unigrams and bigrams in the training dataset. 

After the above steps, you should have four files in total: `<preprocessed-train-csv>`, `<preprocessed-test-csv>`, `<freqdist>`, and `<freqdist-bi>` which are preprocessed train dataset, preprocessed test dataset, frequency distribution of unigrams and frequency distribution of bigrams respectively.

For all the methods that follow, change the values of `TRAIN_PROCESSED_FILE`, `TEST_PROCESSED_FILE`, `FREQ_DIST_FILE`, and `BI_FREQ_DIST_FILE` to your own paths in the respective files. Wherever applicable, values of `USE_BIGRAMS` and `FEAT_TYPE` can be changed to obtain results using different types of features as described in report.

### Naive Bayes
4. Run `naivebayes.py`. With `TRAIN = True` it will show the accuracy results on 10% validation dataset.

### Random Forest
7. Run `randomforest.py`. With `TRAIN = True` it will show the accuracy results on 10% validation dataset.

### SVM
9. Run `svm.py`. With `TRAIN = True` it will show the accuracy results on 10% validation dataset.

## Information about other files

* `dataset/positive-words.txt`: List of positive words.
* `dataset/negative-words.txt`: List of negative words.
* `dataset/glove-seeds.txt`: GloVe words vectors from StanfordNLP which match our dataset for seeding word embeddings.
* `Plots.ipynb`: IPython notebook used to generate plots present in report.
